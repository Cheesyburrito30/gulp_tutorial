# Gulp Tasks
There are two types of tasks in Gulp. Private and Public.

## Public tasks
Public tasks in Gulp are what is exported for the Gulp-CLI to use. We use public tasks to specify what private tasks to run, and which order to run them in. 

## Private tasks
Private tasks in Gulp are where we specify the functionality that we want Gulp to do for our projects. This is where the work happens in Gulp.
