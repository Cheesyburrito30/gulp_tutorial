This is my attempt at explaining Gulp and how to use it in a way that makes
sense to me.

This is in no way a in depth look at Gulp and how it works, but merely me
trying to explain how to use Gulp in a way that is easily understandable.

Each subfolder of this repo will contain a readme file explaining a concept,
and examples showing the concepts put together and in use.

To see the examples in action, clone this repo and in the folder you'd like to view
run `npm install` and then `gulp` to see the examples in action.
